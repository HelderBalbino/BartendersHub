## Incident Response Plan

### In Case of Security Incident

1. **Immediate Response**

    - [ ] Isolate affected systems
    - [ ] Preserve evidence
    - [ ] Assess scope and impact
    - [ ] Document timeline

2. **Containment**

    - [ ] Block malicious traffic
    - [ ] Revoke compromised credentials
    - [ ] Apply emergency patches
    - [ ] Notify stakeholders

3. **Recovery**

    - [ ] Restore from clean backups
    - [ ] Verify system integrity
    - [ ] Update security measures
    - [ ] Monitor for persistence

4. **Post-Incident**
    - [ ] Conduct lessons learned
    - [ ] Update security procedures
    - [ ] Implement additional controls
    - [ ] Train team on findings

## Security Testing Commands

```bash
# Dependency security audit
npm audit

# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated

# Run security-focused tests
npm test -- --grep="security"

# Check for common vulnerabilities
npx audit-ci --moderate
```
