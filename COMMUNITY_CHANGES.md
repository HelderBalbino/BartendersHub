# Community Section - Authentication & API Integration

## 🔐 Changes Implemented

### 1. **Protected Route Implementation**

-   **Community section is now only accessible to logged-in users**
-   Moved `/community` route from public to protected routes in `App.jsx`
-   Updated navbar to only show "Community" link for authenticated users

### 2. **Removed Hardcoded Data**

-   **Completely removed all hardcoded community members** from
    `CommunitySection.jsx`
-   Component now fetches real user data from the backend API
-   No more static mock data - everything is dynamic

### 3. **API Integration**

-   **Added new API endpoints** in `services/api.js`:
    -   `getCommunityMembers(filters)` - Fetch community users with filters
    -   `getUserStats(userId)` - Get user statistics
    -   Follow/unfollow functionality (already existed)

### 4. **Custom Hooks**

-   **Created `useCommunity.js` hook** with:
    -   `useCommunityMembers()` - Fetch and manage community data
    -   `useUserStats()` - Get user statistics
    -   `useFollowUser()` - Handle follow/unfollow actions
    -   `useUserProfile()` - Fetch user profile data

### 5. **Loading & Error States**

-   **Added proper loading states** with LoadingSpinner
-   **Added error handling** for API failures
-   Graceful fallbacks when no data is available
